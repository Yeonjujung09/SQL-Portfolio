# SQL Portfolio 1 - Create a new payments table

Through this case study, I aim to demonstrate my skills in utilizing SQL to extract, manipulate, and prepare data from multiple sources. I'll take you through the steps I followed to solve the Payment Challenge in the [Foodie-Fi](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/) case study.

## Overview

The Foodie-Fi team needs a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
* You can find the example outputs for this table at the bottom of this [page](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).

### Prerequisites

- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example
